        <h1>Tower of Hanoi</h1>
        <p>The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle. It consists of three poles and a number of disks of different
            sizes which can slide onto any pole. The puzzle starts with the disk in a neat stack in ascending order of
            size in one pole, the smallest at the top thus making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to
            move all the disks from one pole (say ‘source pole’) to another pole (say ‘destination pole’) with the help
            of the third pole (say auxiliary pole).</p>

        <h1>Tower of Hanoi: Rules</h1>
        <p>1. The game consists of three pegs and several disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any peg.</p>
        <p>2. The disks are initially placed on one peg in order of decreasing size so that the smallest disk is at the
            top and the largest disk is at the bottom.</p>
        <p>3. The objective of the game is to move the entire stack to another peg, obeying the following rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only one disk can be moved at a time.</li>
            <li>Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another
                stack.</li>
            <li>No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>4. The puzzle can be solved in the minimum number of moves, which is (2^n)-1, where n is the number of disks.
        </p>
        <p>5. These rules apply to any version of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, regardless of the number of pegs or disks
            used.</p>

        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <p>To solve the puzzle, you must move the disks from the initial peg to the target peg, using the spare peg as
            an intermediary. The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is \(2^n - 1\), where
            \(n\) is the number of disks.</p>
        <p>Tower of Hanoi is a recursion based puzzle and thus, we will follow a recursive approach to solve it.
            Consider a puzzle with 3 pillars and 3 disks as shown:
